## About this project

This is a simple GUI based python program to calculate the Mobius function value and Euler's totient function value of a number inputted in the GUI window. The user inputs the number in the entry widget in the GUI which is labelled as "Enter a number", and he get' an ouput of the mobius as well as euler'e totient function output.

### Error handling

Mainly there can be two types of errors:
1. ValueError: The input to the function must be only integers and not any other literal.
2. AssertionError: The input integer must be greater than zero, as non postive integers are not in domain of these functions.

These errors are handled in this program, and the error message is displayed in the GUI window.
